#Anomaly Detection for UCF-Crime with LRCN

This repository implements an LRCN-based anomaly detection system for the UCF-Crime dataset. It identifies abnormal events like abuse, arrest, explosions, etc. in video sequences.

##Features:

* LRCN architecture for video anomaly detection
* Supports various real-world anomalies using UCF-Crime
* Clear code structure for data handling, model creation, and training/testing
**Requirements:**
* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow
* OpenCV (cv2)
* NumPy
* scikit-learn

**Installation:**

1. Clone the repo: 'https://github.com/saqibicp/Anamoly-detection.git'
2. Install the Requirements
3. 3. Run the notebook cells to pre-process data, train the model, and evaluate
